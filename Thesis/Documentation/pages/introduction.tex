\section{Introduction}
Static analysis is the analysis of computer software without the need to fully compile and execute it as opposed to dynamic analysis\cite{dynamic_analysis} which involves running the application. With the help of static analysis we can uncover hard-to-find bugs in the codebase or we can spot potential inefficiencies which otherwise would be hidden to the developers. 
\par It complements traditional testing by providing tools to check aspect of software which could not be done by traditional testing. Testing the performance of an application with the traditional way is much harder than with static analysis. Static analysis can also be used to check for violations of coding conventions.
