\section{Introduction}
Static analysis is the analysis of computer software without the need to fully compile and execute it as opposed to dynamic analysis\cite{dynamic_analysis} which involves running the application. With the help of static analysis we can uncover hard-to-find bugs in the codebase or we can spot potential inefficiencies which otherwise would be hidden to the developers.
